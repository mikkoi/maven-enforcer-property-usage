[Maven Enforcer Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/maven-enforcer-plugin/)
provides goals to control certain environmental constraints such as Maven version,
JDK version and OS family along with many more standard rules and user created rules.

This project, artifact `${project.artifactId}`, is a user created
[custom rule](https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-api/writing-a-custom-rule.html)
to verify the usage of defined properties in the source files of the build.

Rationale
---

It often happens during development that different properties are defined and used,
and then taken out of use but definition is forgotten; they get "left behind"
in the `resources/*.properties` file. This Maven Enforcer rule allows the build
to verify these following:

    - All properties which are defined in properties files, are also used in the source code.
    - All properties used in the source code are also defined in properties files.
    - No property is defined more than once in properties files.
    - When used properties are extracted from the source code, rules can be set for a property name, and thereby force a project policy.

* For a quick adoption of the Enforcer rule, check the [Usage](usage.html) page.
* To know more about the rule's configuration and parameters check the [Configuration page](configuration.html).
* Released builds are available from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/).
